## üìã Prerequisites

Before running the system, you need to install:

### 1. Python 3.8+ 
Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- Verify installation: `python --version`

### 2. Node.js 16+
Download from: https://nodejs.org/
- This includes npm package manager
- Verify installation: `node --version` and `npm --version`

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Initialize Database with Sample Data
```bash
python initialize_data.py
```
This creates the database and populates it with 12+ months of realistic sample data.

### Step 3: Start the System

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
python start_backend.py
```
- API available at: http://localhost:8000
- Documentation at: http://localhost:8000/docs

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
- Dashboard available at: http://localhost:3000

## üéØ What You Can Do

### Dashboard Features
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Current electricity prices and dam levels
2. **Historical Analysis**: 12+ months of data with interactive charts
3. **Price Predictions**: AI-powered predictions for trading insights
4. **Regional Analysis**: Compare prices across NSW, VIC, QLD, SA, TAS
5. **Dam Monitoring**: Track 20+ major dams across Australia

### Trading Insights
- Price trend analysis
- Correlation between dam levels and electricity prices
- Predictive models for price fluctuations
- Confidence scoring for trading decisions
- Risk factor analysis

## üìä Sample Data Included

The system comes with realistic sample data:
- **Electricity Prices**: 43,800+ records (5 regions √ó 24 hours √ó 365 days)
- **Dam Levels**: 7,300+ records (20+ dams √ó 365 days)
- **Price Range**: $20-$200 AUD/MWh (realistic market range)
- **Dam Levels**: 30%-100% capacity (realistic storage levels)

## üîß API Endpoints

### Electricity Prices
- `GET /api/electricity/prices/current` - Current prices
- `GET /api/electricity/prices/trends?days=30` - Price trends
- `GET /api/electricity/prices?region=NSW` - Filtered data

### Dam Levels
- `GET /api/dams/levels/current` - Current dam levels
- `GET /api/dams/levels/trends?days=30` - Dam level trends
- `GET /api/dams/levels?state=NSW` - Filtered data

### System
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/stats` - Database statistics

## üé® Dashboard Pages

1. **Dashboard** (`/`) - Overview with key metrics and charts
2. **Electricity Prices** (`/electricity`) - Detailed price analysis
3. **Dam Levels** (`/dams`) - Water storage monitoring
4. **Predictions** (`/predictions`) - AI-powered price predictions

## üö® Important Notes

### Data Sources
- Currently uses **sample data** for demonstration
- Real implementation would connect to AEMO and water authority APIs
- Sample data is realistic and based on actual market patterns

### Trading Disclaimer
- This is for **educational and research purposes**
- Always consult financial advisors before trading
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results

### Next Steps for Production
1. Connect to real AEMO data feeds
2. Implement proper authentication
3. Add more sophisticated ML models
4. Set up automated data collection
5. Deploy to cloud infrastructure

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Python Issues
- Make sure Python is in your PATH
- Try `python3` instead of `python`
- On Windows, try `py` command

### Node.js Issues
- Clear cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Delete node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

### Database Issues
- Delete `electricity_data.db` and run `python initialize_data.py` again
- Check file permissions

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the full `SETUP.md` for detailed instructions
2. Review the API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs
3. Check browser console for frontend errors
4. Review terminal output for backend errors

## üéâ You're Ready!

Once you have Python and Node.js installed, you can start the system and begin exploring the Australian electricity market data. The dashboard provides a solid foundation for understanding price patterns and developing trading strategies.

**Happy Trading! üìà‚ö°**
